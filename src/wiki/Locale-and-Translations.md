### Contributing translations
I (and everyone else) would be grateful if those who do make translations submit the changes back to the project so others can benefit.

The [en_US](https://github.com/LuckPerms/locale/blob/master/en_US.yml) translation should be used as a baseline. Only the values should be changed. The keys should remain the same.
